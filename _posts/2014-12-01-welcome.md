Hello.

Another TYPO3 blog which will be not only used as a personal notepad but also as a place to stay up to date with the 
TYPO3 universum around me.

## Why using jekyll

* Jekyll is a great way to set up a blog in no time.
* No need for maintenance, updates
* It is the tool which fits my needs
