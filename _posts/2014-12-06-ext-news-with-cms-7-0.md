The first snapshot of TYPO3 CMS 7 has just been released and the latest [GIT version](https://git.typo3.org/TYPO3CMS/Extensions/news.git) of EXT:news is already compatible!

The current changes are:

* Start to adopt the styling of the backend modules
* Use new module icons
* Use only the namespaced variant of classes

Those changes are only visible if you are using at least version 7.0 and are fully compatible to 6.2 LTS. 

The backend will be further adopted to take advantages of twitter bootstrap.

You can get the GIT version of EXT:news either at the original GIT repository ([git.typo3.org/TYPO3CMS/Extensions/news.git](https://git.typo3.org/TYPO3CMS/Extensions/news.git)) or the mirror at github ([github.com/TYPO3-extensions/news](https://github.com/TYPO3-extensions/news)).
